## Disclaimer

These are my personal notes that I create while learning DevOps. The notes may or may not be updated for the latest changes in various DevOps tools. They are only intended to be correct at the time of writing, even though I try hard to keep them current as far as possible.

## Roadmap

You can follow this roadmap to structure your learning in incremental depths towards the final goal. The content in this repository follows this roadmap as well.

[DevOps Roadmap: Learn to become a DevOps Engineer or SRE](https://roadmap.sh/devops)

## Resources

If you wish to keep your learning outside of this repository, here is a collection of resources to help you out. I have tried to keep only the free ones.
