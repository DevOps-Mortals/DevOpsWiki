# DevOps Wiki

:::info Update

Certain sections of this wiki are still blank. That is because I am still learning them. I have no intention to populate this website with plagiarised content.

:::

DevOps Wiki is a central place where I collect all my learnings in the world of DevOps. This website was generated using [Docusaurus](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus). This website should be used as an entry point into the world of DevOps and it's various tools. This documentation is not completely exhaustive in any manner.

## Disclaimer

These are my personal notes that I create while learning DevOps. The notes may or may not be updated for the latest changes in various DevOps tools. They are only intended to be correct at the time of writing, even though I try hard to keep them current as far as possible.

## Roadmap

You can follow this roadmap to structure your learning in incremental depths towards the final goal. The content in this repository follows this roadmap as well.

[DevOps Roadmap: Learn to become a DevOps Engineer or SRE](https://roadmap.sh/devops)

## Resources

If you wish to keep your learning outside of this repository, here is a collection of resources to help you out. I have tried to keep only the free ones.

## Contributing

If you come across any errors or feel like there are better ways of executing commands, feel free to open an issue and a PR.

If you find value out of these and wish to contribute in any manner, do read the CONTRIBUTING. I welcome any and all types of contributions.
