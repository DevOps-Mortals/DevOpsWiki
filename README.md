DevOps Wiki is a central place where I collect all my learnings in the world of DevOps. This website was generated using [Docusaurus](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus). This website should be used as an entry point into the world of DevOps and it's various tools. This documentation is not completely exhaustive in any manner. 

## Disclaimer

I DO NOT claim any guarantee that this material is accurate or can be applied in environments other than learning. There are commands and software that can alter system configurations. I can not and will not guarantee that everything works as intended. Any damage or misconfiguration caused shall be your sole responsibility. It is always recommended to cross-reference with the official documentation before applying anything.

## Contributing

If you come across any errors or feel like there are better ways of executing commands, feel free to open an issue and a PR.
